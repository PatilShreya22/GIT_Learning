Hey Shreya Bharamanna Patil here!
Currently learning new basic git

So to create a .git repository, you need to go to the folder where your project is currently going on and in there type the following command
>git init

To see the status of your repository, you can use the following command
>git status

To add untraced files to the folder, you can use
>git add .  //This will add everything present in your  OR
>git add filename


To commit the changes that you made in your project
>git commit -m "Message you want to convey"

To remove from the stage, use the following command
>git restore --staged filename

Everything will be saved in the git logs, just type
>git log

By mistake, if you delete the file and now you want to bring it back
>git log -->Copy the hash code you wish to invoke(You can't just take out any the stacked commits will be deleted)
>git reset hash code
>git status
>git add .
>git stash
>git status


If you don't want to commit the changes but also don't want to lose the changes as well, for that
>git status
>git add .
>git stash

TO bring them back, just do
>git stash pop

To remove them from the stage
>git stash clear

Okay, when you're working on a project and you want to push your project on GITHUB for that
>git remote add origin https://github.com/PatilShreya22/GIT_Learning.git

To see which GitHub accounts are connected
>git remote -v

Now  to push it to GitHub
>git push origin master

When you link to others, GitHub upstream is used
>git remote add upstream https://github.com/commclassroom/commclassroomOP.git

To create a new branch
>git branch name

To point to that branch
>git checkout name
