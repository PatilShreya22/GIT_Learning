Hey Shreya Bharamanna Patil here!
Currently learning new basic git

so to create a .git repository, you need to go to the folder where your project is currently going on and in there type following command
>git init

To see the status of your repository, you can use the following command
>git status

To add untraced files to the folder, you can use
>git add .  //This will add everything present in your  OR
>git add filename


To commit the changes that you made in your project
>git commit -m "Message you want to convey"

To remove from the stage, use the following command
>git restore --staged filename
